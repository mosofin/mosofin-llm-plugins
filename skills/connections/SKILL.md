description: Show which company files and data sources are connected to a MosoFin workspace and their status (maps to the get_agent_datasources MCP tool). Use when the user asks what's connected, which companies are linked, whether QuickBooks is working, or needs to reconnect a data source.

# Connection status

Status-only path; fetches no accounting data. Same contract as
`/mosofin:query-workspace`. Full spec: `docs/mcp-tool-spec.md`.

## Steps

1. Confirm workspace via `list_workspaces` if this chat has not already.
2. `get_agent_datasources` for the confirmed `workspace_id`.
3. Report each company file by `display_name` with its platform and whether it
   is connected (`connected: true` iff status ACTIVE). Never show raw
   `data_source_id` values or integer ids.
4. For a disconnected source: reconnecting happens in the MosoFin workspace
   data-sources page, or via the `reconnect_url` a data fetch error returns.
   Do not attempt data calls against a disconnected source, and never invent
   numbers for it.

If the user then wants data from a connected company, continue with
`/mosofin:list-tools`, `/mosofin:run-tool`, or `/mosofin:query-workspace`.
